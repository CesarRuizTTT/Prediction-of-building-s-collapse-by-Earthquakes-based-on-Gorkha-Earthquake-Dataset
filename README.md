The purpose of this study is to predict if a building is subject to collapse by the effect of 
earthquakes, through machine learning algorithms, undertaking a comparison of their 
perform. This study approaches the problem as a supervised binary classifications case, 
using a dataset related to the Gorkha 7,8 magnitude earthquake, which happened in the 
district of Gandaki, Pradesh, Nepal in April 2015. The consequences of this earthquake 
were at a disaster dimension level, with around 9000 fatalities and millions of people who 
lost their houses, with circa $10 billion lost in infrastructures.
This dataset is one of the largest datasetsregistered after this kind of catastrophe, focused 
on building damage, with several files available that add information related to the 
financial, social, geographical and structural conditions of the area and the buildings 
involved. Although this dataset has a multivariable target as the grade of damage of the 
related buildings, this study has generated a customise dataset and target, establishing a 
binary variable for “Building collapse”, and a dataset extracted from the different files and 
features available, selecting and generating which have been considered relevant for the 
study. These facts make this study very special, as even when this dataset has been used 
several times for machine learning approaches, the tailored target and features make this 
challenge unique as there are not previous studies with this approach.
To embrace this challenge, different algorithms has been applied, based on the state of 
the art of binary classification problems, such Extreme Gradient Boosting, as in [28], [13], 
[40], [15] and [33], Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees and Random Forest, and 
different combination of the dataset have been used to train the different models, as a 
result of feature engineering processes, obtaining different values of perform
